CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:26 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findgazebo_dev.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "gazebo_dev", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "gazebo_dev" with
  any of the following names:

    gazebo_devConfig.cmake
    gazebo_dev-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "gazebo_dev" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "gazebo_dev_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "gazebo_dev" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
